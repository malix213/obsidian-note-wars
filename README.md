# Obsidian Note Wars

## Overview

**Obsidian Note Wars** is a gamified Obsidian plugin designed to make note‑making more engaging, consistent, and rewarding. It transforms everyday actions—writing notes, creating links, organizing ideas—into playful challenges that encourage momentum and healthy habits inside your vault.

Instead of passively collecting notes, Note Wars motivates you to **show up, write, connect, and improve**—one small win at a time.

## Philosophy

Great knowledge systems are built through *consistent action*, not perfection.

Obsidian Note Wars applies light‑weight gamification to reinforce behaviors that lead to better thinking:

* Writing instead of postponing
* Linking instead of isolating
* Refining instead of hoarding

The plugin is intentionally minimal and optional. It does **not** replace your workflow—it quietly supports it.

## Core Ideas

### 🧠 Active Note‑Making

Progress is driven by meaningful actions such as:

* Creating notes
* Editing and expanding content
* Linking ideas together

### 🎯 Challenges, Not Pressure

The plugin encourages progress through **small challenges** rather than rigid goals, helping you build sustainable habits without overwhelm.

### 🏆 Gentle Progression

Visual indicators and simple progression mechanics help you:

* Stay motivated
* Notice consistency over time
* Celebrate effort, not volume

## Who This Plugin Is For

Obsidian Note Wars is ideal if you:

* Have unorganized notes spread across folders or directories
* Feel chaos or inconsistency in your tagging system
* Rarely link notes together and want a cleaner starting point
* Want to turn messy collections into usable vaults
* Prefer guidance and structure over heavy automation

---

## What This Plugin Is NOT

* Not a task manager
* Not a productivity scoreboard
* Not a replacement for your PKM method

Think of it as a **friendly companion**, not a strict coach.

Nick Milo’s ideas emphasize **active note-making, intentional linking, and sustainable thinking habits**, which strongly influence the philosophy behind this plugin.
